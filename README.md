I am beginning my journey as a self-taught programmer, and I want to document my progress while I learn and try new things in C++. I will start with the basics and then hopefully progress to making more projects that could potentially be useful. I am doing all of this to see if I would want to pursue a career as a developer (whether full-stack or another area). In the future, I plan on enrolling in college to enhance my programming skills and to learn the required math to be a competent developer.
